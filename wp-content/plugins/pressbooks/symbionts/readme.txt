Operative verb is "should," the following libs have been patched/forked by Pressbooks:

* custom-metadata (https://github.com/pressbooks/custom-metadata)

* mce-table-buttons (https://github.com/pressbooks/mce-table-buttons)
* search-regex (https://github.com/pressbooks/search-regex)

 + search-regex
